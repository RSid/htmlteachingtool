    <p>
      This is a p (paragraph) tag, and should be used for paragraphs of text.
      Most browsers automatically add some margin before and after it. This can
      be adjusted using CSS.
    </p>

    <div>
      This is a div tag. It is one of the most flexible tags and can be used for
      many things. No extra margin automatically added here!
    </div>

    <div class="pink">These divs are pink</div>

    <br>

    <div class="inline"> These divs are inline. </div>
    <div class="inline">
      Which means they will show up next to eachother on the same line
    </div>

    <p class="inline">These paragraphs are too</p>
    <p class="inline">So they will do the same</p>

    <br>

    <div class="inlineblock">These divs are inline-block</div>
    <div class="inlineblock twoemhigh">
      The difference between these and inline elements is these guys
      can have a height and width. I set a specific height here to demonstrate.
    </div>

    <p>
      The line below is a paragraph tag with no text in it.
      You're just seeing its borders.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <div class="half">
      This div has a width of half the page, no matter what size the page is.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div id="threehundredpxwidth">
      This div has an id, meaning its styling is unique, and is always 300 pixels
      wide, regardless of the size of the page.
    </div>

    <div class="half centered">
      This div is centered in the page. I did this by using the same styling I used
      to make a div half the size of the page, then I added a margin of 1/4 the
      size of the page on either side of it. So you can figure out the size of each
      margin by doing:
      (<strong>Width of the page</strong> - <strong>Width of your div</strong>)/
      <strong>2</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="padded">
      This div has a padding of 5 pixels all the way around. So it <em> pads out </em>
      the space around the text inside the div, but the div itself is still resing
      flush against the nearest ones.

      You can set it to only have padding on some subset of sides as well.
    </div>

    <div class="margin">
      This div has a margin of 5 pixels all the way around. So there's no padding on
      the text, but the div itself has a 5 pixel margin between it and everything around it.
      You can set it to only have margin on some subset of sides as well.
    </div>
